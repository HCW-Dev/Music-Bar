	<p>Version 1.6 contains two changes. Sorry for not updating in a while! Quite some time goes into maintaining this app and keeping it up-to-date, so if you can, please <a href="https://www.paypal.me/musa11971">donate</a>. Every little bit helps and it motivates me to make more cool stuff! ðŸ’œ</p>

		<li><strong>Player controls are now hidden when opened</strong> <br>
