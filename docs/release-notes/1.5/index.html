	<p>Version 1.5 contains two important changes. I hope you are still enjoying Music Bar. Quite some time goes into maintaining this app and keeping it up-to-date, so if you can, please <a href="https://www.paypal.me/musa11971">donate</a>. Every little bit helps and it motivates me to make more cool stuff! ðŸ’œ</p>

	<strong>Changes this update:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Track artwork is now shown with 100% accuracy! ðŸŽ‰</strong> <br>
			Previously, artwork would be requested in the background every time. Artwork will now be retrieved directly from your Apple Music client. <br>
			What does this mean?
			<ul>
				<li>Your artwork will be shown with 100% accuracy (even your own uploaded artwork).</li>
				<li>Artwork is shown faster.</li>
				<li>No additional bandwith will be used anymore.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Fixed crashing on some systems</strong> <br>
			Some systems did not like the new icons and crashed sometimes.<br>
			Bug reported in <a href="https://github.com/musa11971/Music-Bar/issues/57">Issue #57</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
