		<strong>Important note:</strong> <br>
		<p>macOS Big Sur, unfortunately, contains a bug that impacts Music Bar's functionality. We are currently unable to show track information for songs that are not in your library. We hope Apple will fix this issue and otherwise we will need to find a workaround. <br>
