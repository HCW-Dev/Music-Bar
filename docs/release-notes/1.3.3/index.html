		<li><strong>Added macOS 10.14 (Mojave) support</strong> <br>
			Music Bar was previously only supported on Catalina. Mojave support has been added. Tell your friends! ðŸ˜— <br>
			This was requested in <a href="https://github.com/musa11971/Music-Bar/issues/38">Issue #38</a>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Fixed a bug when using multiple desktops</strong> <br>
			The popover would previously send you to the desktop that you opened Music Bar in. From now on, the popover will simply open in the desktop you are currently using. <br>
			This bug was mentioned in:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/musa11971/Music-Bar/issues/30">Issue #30</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/musa11971/Music-Bar/issues/39">Issue #39</a></li>
